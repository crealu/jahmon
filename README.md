Music tabulating web app.

&nbsp;
## Usage
This app can be used to save sequences of chords and riffs written/played on the guitar. The user selects the notes that they are using in their song writing and saves them as a step in the sequence they are creating.


&nbsp;
## Dev
To run on your local, copy this repo and run the following commands in the terminal.

`npm run devb`
`npm run devf`

In order to save sequences, you will need to configure an external (mongo) database with a URI key.
